We will start by opening the start menu search bar amd type "Windows Features" from there you will click "turn window features on or off"  This will pull up a window with a list of folders and checkboxes.  from there we will select the IIS(Information Internet Services) and let the IIS install.

Now after we have the IIS finish, we will go to the google doc and download the WebPlatformInstaller file. The file will download this launcher as shown above, go through the installation when complete the following will appear.

Once we select finish we will then head over to the windows search and type in platform. The Web Platform Installer 5.1 should appear. moving to the search bar at the top right we will type in MySQL and select the MySQL Windows 5.5 released 9/9/2015.

<p>
Next after adding MySQL go back to the search bar and type PHP. From there filter the names by pressing name and locate the PHP ....(x86) files you want to add them up until you reach PHP 7.4.13 (x86). The image above from the lab shows the exact files, there should be exactly 12 items to be installed after selecting the files.

<p>
Next press the install button and you should recieve a prompt on a new username for MySQL as root and to create the password(Document these 2 pieces of information they will be used later in the lab).
